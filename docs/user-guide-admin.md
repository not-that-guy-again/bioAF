# Admin User Guide

This guide covers bioAF administration: user management, infrastructure components, cost monitoring, backups, notifications, and platform upgrades.

## User Management

Navigate to **Users & Roles**:

- View all users with their roles and status
- Change user roles: admin, comp_bio, bench, viewer
- Deactivate users who have left
- Invite new users via email

### Roles

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| admin | Full platform access, settings, user management |
| comp_bio | Pipelines, notebooks, environments, packages |
| bench | Experiments, samples, data upload, results |
| viewer | Read-only access to experiments and results |

## Infrastructure Components

Navigate to **Components**:

- Enable/disable infrastructure components through the UI
- Each toggle triggers a Terraform apply
- View component health status
- Dependencies are enforced (e.g., JupyterHub requires SLURM + Filestore)

## Cost Center

Navigate to **Cost Center** (admin sidebar):

- **Current month spend** with daily trend
- **Breakdown by component** showing which services cost the most
- **Budget configuration**: set monthly budget and alert thresholds
- **Projected month-end** based on current daily average

### Budget Alerts

Configure alerts at 50%, 80%, and 100% of budget:

- Notifications sent via configured channels (in-app, email, Slack)
- Optional **scale-to-zero** at 100% stops compute workloads automatically

## Backup & Recovery

Navigate to **Backup & Recovery** (admin sidebar):

- View backup status for each tier: Cloud SQL, Filestore, GCS, Platform Config, Terraform State
- Each tier shows: last backup, size, next scheduled, retention policy
- **Config snapshots**: browse and diff configuration backups
- **Restore**: initiate restore for Cloud SQL (PITR), Filestore, or platform config
- **Settings**: adjust retention periods (minimum 7 days PITR, 30 days snapshots)

## Notifications

### Slack Webhooks (Settings)

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Under Slack Webhooks, add a webhook:
   - Name (e.g., "Alerts Channel")
   - Webhook URL from Slack
   - Channel name
3. Test with the "Test Slack" button

### Notification Rules

Configure which events trigger notifications and through which channels:

- Pipeline completions/failures
- Budget threshold alerts
- Backup failures
- Component health issues

### SMTP (Settings)

Configure SMTP for email notifications:

- Host, port, credentials, from address
- Required for email invitations and email notifications

## Platform Upgrades

In **Settings** under Platform Version:

- View current version and check for updates
- Review changelog before upgrading
- Upgrade history with status tracking
- bioAF checks for updates daily and shows a notification when available

## Access Logs

Navigate to **Access Logs** (admin sidebar):

- View who accessed what resource and when
- Filter by user, resource type, action, and date range
- Useful for compliance and auditing

## Settings Overview

The **Settings** page centralizes:

- SMTP configuration
- Slack webhook management
- Platform version and upgrades
- Test notification delivery

## Tips

- The **Home** dashboard shows admin-specific metrics: cost summary, system health, experiment counts
- Use **Activity Feed** to monitor team activity
- Set up Slack webhooks early for real-time alerts
- Review access logs periodically for security compliance
